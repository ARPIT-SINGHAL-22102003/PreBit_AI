# 📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction using XGBoost

This project focuses on predicting **Bitcoin prices** using the **XGBoost Machine Learning algorithm**. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, and its price is known for high volatility. By applying XGBoost, we aim to build a predictive model that helps understand price trends based on historical data.
