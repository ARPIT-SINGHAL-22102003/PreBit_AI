This Notebook is all about Bitcoin Price Prediction using XGBoost AlgorithmÂ¶
Bitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely virtual. It's like an online version of cash. Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.
XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) A wide range of applications: Can be used to solve regression, classification, ranking, and user-defined prediction problems.
